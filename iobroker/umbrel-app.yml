description: >-
     🏠 ioBroker is a powerful open-source home automation platform that allows you to flexibly integrate and control hundreds of smart home devices and protocols — including Zigbee, Z-Wave, KNX, MQTT, Enocean, and more.

     You can control devices via a modern web interface, create custom automations, and run your entire smart home entirely offline — no mandatory cloud, no data harvesting, full data ownership.

     📌 SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:

     - Access the ioBroker dashboard at port 8097 - USB devices such as Zigbee sticks may require manual configuration and access permissions - Adapters are installed and managed through the ioBroker web interface - Upon first login, follow the setup wizard to start adding devices and integrations

     For more information and support, visit the official ioBroker community forum.
